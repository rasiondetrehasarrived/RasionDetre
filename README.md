## school update

ok so, school had started already and i wanted to js put this as a heads up for my friends. i am gonna be offline a lot due to school, homework, and pressure (holy name drop.) i am very busy, along wiht how my laptop is breaking piece by piece. 

- *otherwise*

  is because i rush a lot with all apps i use, and i get very exhausted whenever im online that i would reply dryly, and dont keep true with my words if i say that i am goign to leave for 15 minutes. i can get easily distracted and/or busy helping my parents, doing chores, or working on school projects.
